The asyfig package

[Package description goes here.]

Run `latex` on asyfig.tex to produce the files
  asyfig.ins, asyfig.sty, asyalign.sty, asyprocess.sty, and README.txt,
as well as to compile the PDF documentation.

Execute `tex pstool.ins` to produce the files above
except pstool.ins (and the PDF file, obviously).
